#### This final project also serves as a preliminary research for a joint project between me and [Prof. Craig Borowiak](https://ww3.haverford.edu/politicalscience/faculty/borowiak/) of Haverford College under the umbrella of alternative economy. The aim of the larger project is to understand the important factors that would influence the operational scale activity level and organizational longevity of the time bank. This project also aims to provide a typology of time bank can help us better understand the operation of time banks, and potentially provide customized assistance to different time banks that would suite their specific needs.
